## HOW TO RUN
Requirement: Python 2.7
Do: python main.py(single-thread) or python main_thread.py(multi-thread)

## ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE:
I create 5 thread to run the program. It allows new input data and deal with data when another thread is still running.

## To improve:
There's another way using callback function. I can have a try practicing that.
